✅ Reinforced logic, optimized approach & spotted patterns faster.
📌 Revision is as important as solving new problems. Let’s keep the consistency going! 

Day 14:Revision day
Concept Recall
Took a light day today but stayed in touch with DSA by revisiting some important concepts mentally.

💭 Recalled Topics:
Time & Space Complexity basics
Common patterns in Arrays & Strings
Binary Search edge cases
🔁 Not every day needs to be problem-solving. Even passive revision keeps the momentum going.

Day 14: String basic ✅
Today I revised core **String concepts** in DSA.  
Here’s a quick summary of what I brushed up:
# String Basics:
- **Strings are immutable** in Java → Once created, cannot be changed.
- Stored as a sequence of characters → Internally uses character arrays.

# Common String Operations:
| Operation | Method | Example |
|---------- |--------|---------|
| Length    | `str.length()`   | `"abc".length()` → 3 |
| Char at index | `str.charAt(i)` | `"abc".charAt(1)` → `'b'` |
| Substring     | `str.substring(start, end)` | `"abcdef".substring(1,4)` → `"bcd"` |
| Equality      | `str.equals(str2)` | `"abc".equals("abc")` → `true` |
| Ignore case   | `str.equalsIgnoreCase(str2)` | `"ABC".equalsIgnoreCase("abc")` → `true` |
| Concatenation | `str1 + str2` or `str.concat(str2)` | `"a" + "b"` → `"ab"` |

# Interview Key Points:
- Use `.toCharArray()` for character-based problems  
- Know how to reverse a string using `StringBuilder`  
- Understand **StringBuilder vs String** (mutable vs immutable)  
- Learn frequency counting with HashMap or int[26] for lowercase letters
-Check if a string is a palindrome

Day 15: Problem Solving on String ✅

- Valid Anagram

Day 16: Problem Solving on String ✅

 - Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

Day 17: Problem Solving on String ✅

Day 18: Problem Solving on String ✅
- Longest common prefix
- Group Anagrams

Day 19: Problem Solving on String ✅
 - Longest Happy Prefix
 - Minimum Window Substring

Day 20: Revision day
String Revision – 
✅ Reverse a String
Use StringBuilder or manual two-pointer approach.
Reverse in place for char[] using swap.

✅ Palindrome Check
Compare characters from start & end (left, right).
Move pointers inward; stop if mismatch.

✅ Anagram Check
Same length strings + same character counts.
Use frequency array (int[26]) or HashMap<Character, Integer>.
Sorting both strings & comparing is also valid.

✅ Longest Common Prefix
Compare prefix with each string.
Shrink prefix until all strings start with it.
Return empty string "" if no common prefix.

✅ Group Anagrams
Anagrams → same sorted string.
Use HashMap<sortedString, List<String>>.
Collect all words with same sorted key.

✅ Permutation in String
Use sliding window of length s1.length().
Keep character frequency counts of window & s1.
Slide window: add right char, remove left char; compare counts.

✅ String Compression
Use two pointers (read, write).
Count consecutive repeating chars.
Write char + count (if >1) in place.

✏️ Other Useful Points:
'a' - 'a' trick → map char 'a'–'z' to index 0–25.
StringBuilder for efficient string concatenation.
.equals() vs == → use .equals() to compare string values.
Strings are immutable → changes create new objects.
