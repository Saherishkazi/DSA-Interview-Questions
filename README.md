- Today was all about revision!
  Revised all previously solved DSA questions to strengthen concepts and improve speed & accuracy.
üß† Topics Revisited:
   # Arrays
   # 2D-Arrays
   # Two Pointers
   # Hashing
   # Sliding Window
   # Prefix and suffix

‚úÖ Reinforced logic, optimized approach & spotted patterns faster.
üìå Revision is as important as solving new problems. Let‚Äôs keep the consistency going! 

Day 14:Revision day
Concept Recall
Took a light day today but stayed in touch with DSA by revisiting some important concepts mentally.

üí≠ Recalled Topics:
Time & Space Complexity basics
Common patterns in Arrays & Strings
Binary Search edge cases
üîÅ Not every day needs to be problem-solving. Even passive revision keeps the momentum going.

Day 14: String basic ‚úÖ
Today I revised core **String concepts** in DSA.  
Here‚Äôs a quick summary of what I brushed up:
# String Basics:
- **Strings are immutable** in Java ‚Üí Once created, cannot be changed.
- Stored as a sequence of characters ‚Üí Internally uses character arrays.

# Common String Operations:
| Operation | Method | Example |
|---------- |--------|---------|
| Length    | `str.length()`   | `"abc".length()` ‚Üí 3 |
| Char at index | `str.charAt(i)` | `"abc".charAt(1)` ‚Üí `'b'` |
| Substring     | `str.substring(start, end)` | `"abcdef".substring(1,4)` ‚Üí `"bcd"` |
| Equality      | `str.equals(str2)` | `"abc".equals("abc")` ‚Üí `true` |
| Ignore case   | `str.equalsIgnoreCase(str2)` | `"ABC".equalsIgnoreCase("abc")` ‚Üí `true` |
| Concatenation | `str1 + str2` or `str.concat(str2)` | `"a" + "b"` ‚Üí `"ab"` |

# Interview Key Points:
- Use `.toCharArray()` for character-based problems  
- Know how to reverse a string using `StringBuilder`  
- Understand **StringBuilder vs String** (mutable vs immutable)  
- Learn frequency counting with HashMap or int[26] for lowercase letters
-Check if a string is a palindrome

Day 15: Problem Solving on String ‚úÖ

- Valid Anagram

Day 16: Problem Solving on String ‚úÖ

 - Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

Day 17: Problem Solving on String ‚úÖ

- String Compression

Day 18: Problem Solving on String ‚úÖ
- Longest common prefix
- Group Anagrams
